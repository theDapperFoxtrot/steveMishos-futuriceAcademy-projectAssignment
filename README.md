Making a small app that can provide an at-a-glance look at my current repos from my website without needing to visit github.

I elected to create a portfolio-style web app to showcase my personal repos. This is a very practical addition to my portfolio website that will allow the list to dynamically populate and order themselves based on my activity. I loved the inspiration provided by the assignment! I can't wait to learn more and take ideas like this even farther!
